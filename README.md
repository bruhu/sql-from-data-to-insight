# SQL Database Mini Project: Insights from Global Happiness Scores

## Overview

In this mini project, we will explore the world of SQL and Python by creating and populating a database, then using SQL queries and Python visualizations to derive meaningful insights. 
The project revolves around analyzing global happiness scores, exploring factors that influence these scores, and making recommendations to improve quality of life worldwide.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains all raw and clean datasets used in the project.
- `scripts/`: SQL scripts for database creation, data import, and queries.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and visualization.
- `README.md`: Project overview and documentation.

## Datasets:
For this project, we used 4 datasets, the main dataset was the world happiness ranking and score. We also add three datasets for GDP per capita, freedom score and life expectancy to examine the correlations between these indexes and happiness score. You can find the datasets here:

## Data Description

- World Happiness Data: Contains yearly happiness scores by country with factors such as GDP, social support, life expectancy.
- Freedom Score: Measures civil liberties and personal freedom, sourced from Cato Institute.
- Life Expectancy: Average life expectancy by country, sourced from the WHO.
- GDP per Capita: Yearly GDP per capita by country, sourced from World Bank.

## Key Objectives

- Data Exploration: Identify factors that affect happiness scores around the world.
- Business Insights: Propose strategies for businesses to target regions with low happiness scores and expand services where they are most needed.
- Visualization: Use Python to create compelling visualizations that illustrate our findings.

## Setup

This project is a team effort, with each member contributing to different aspects. Tasks will be divided and planned out throughout the week, ensuring both effective data exploration and insightful analysis.

## Tools:

- Database: MySQL (for creating and managing the database)
- Python: Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Git: Version control for managing the codebase

## Key Findings

- Countries with higher GDP tend to have higher scores, but those with better social support and freedom show even higher happiness levels, even with a lower GDP.
- Countries with lower corruption and stronger social structures tend to have higher happiness scores, suggesting that improving these areas, especially in lower-income countries, could boost overall well-being.
