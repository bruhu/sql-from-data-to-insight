# SQL Database Mini Project: Insights from Global Happiness Scores


## Overview

In this mini project, we will explore the world of SQL and Python by creating and populating a database, then using SQL queries and Python visualizations to derive meaningful insights. 
The project revolves around analyzing global happiness scores, exploring factors that influence these scores, and making recommendations to improve quality of life worldwide.

## Datasets:
For this project, we used 4 datasets, the main dataset was the world happiness ranking and score. We also add three datasets for GDP per capita, freedom score and life expectancy to examine the correlations between these indexes and happiness score. You can find the datasets here:

## Key Objectives

- Data Exploration: Identify factors that affect happiness scores around the world.
- Business Insights: Propose strategies for businesses to target regions with low happiness scores and expand services where they are most needed.
- Visualization: Use Python to create compelling visualizations that illustrate our findings.


## Setup

To see the database, you can use the Database.sql file in MySQL Workbench to import the database structure, tables and its contents into MySQL. 

Required tools:

- Database: MySQL Workbench(for creating and managing the database)
- Python: Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Git: Version control for managing the codebase
