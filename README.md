# SQL Database Mini Project: Insights from Global Happiness Scores


## Overview

In this mini project, we will explore the world of SQL and Python by creating and populating a database, then using SQL queries and Python visualizations to derive meaningful insights. 
The project revolves around analyzing global happiness scores, exploring factors that influence these scores, and making recommendations to improve quality of life worldwide.


## Key Objectives

- Data Exploration: Identify factors that affect happiness scores around the world.
- Business Insights: Propose strategies for businesses to target regions with low happiness scores and expand services where they are most needed.
- Visualization: Use Python to create compelling visualizations that illustrate our findings.


## Setup

This project is a team effort, with each member contributing to different aspects. Tasks will be divided and planned out throughout the week, ensuring both effective data exploration and insightful analysis.

Tools:

- Database: MySQL (for creating and managing the database)
- Python: Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Git: Version control for managing the codebase


## Brief

The project begins by selecting datasets relevant to global happiness scores. We used data from sources like Kaggle, APIs, and CSV files. 
The datasets were chosen for their relevance to understanding happiness metrics and their ability to support meaningful analysis when combined.
